## Detect walls
Use Lidar to detect the distance between wall and robots

## Navigation
- Wall in range: if detect wall front, then turn to a feasible range with wall and find the sign
- Follow the sign: classify the sign and get right action of robot


## Steps
1.
1.1 Test which points are best for identify signs
1.2 Use Lidar to predict the distance of wall in front of robots
